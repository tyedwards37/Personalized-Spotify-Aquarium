Project: Personalized Spotify Aquarium
by Tyler Edwards 
FUTURE PROJECT

Description: A website that prompts the user to authenticate their spotify account then produces a custom aquarium based off their most listened to genres and artists. The design will feature different tank layouts and the fish's names (artist names) below the tank.

Language: Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. 

Reason: I was inspired by websites such as receiptify and the Spotify iceberg and wanted to try working with the Spotify API. 

Plan: 
        1. Research the Spotify API.
        2. Practice using the function calls of the API with a basic Spotify scraper.
                a. Ensure that it can access another person's account, without directly having them type it into the code.
        3. Work with an arist to create the differnt fish and the overall tank layout. 
                a. Possible idea of making the tank 3D with 2D fish in it. (3D fish even?) 
        4. Code the actual program in Python.
        5. Test the program and make any adjustments.
        6. Figure out how to host the website.
